<text><paragraph>INOmax (nitric oxide gas) is a drug administered by inhalation.  Nitric oxide, the active substance in INOmax, is a pulmonary vasodilator.  INOmax is a gaseous blend of nitric oxide  and nitrogen (0.08% and 99.92%, respectively for 800 ppm; 0.01% and 99.99%, respectively for 100 ppm).  INOmax is supplied in aluminum cylinders as a compressed gas under high pressure (2000 pounds per square inch gauge [psig]).  </paragraph><paragraph>The structural formula of nitric oxide (NO) is shown below:</paragraph><renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM1" /></text>

<text><paragraph>Nitric oxide is a compound produced by many cells of the body.   It relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylate cyclase, activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, which then leads to vasodilation. When inhaled, nitric oxide produces pulmonary vasodilation. </paragraph><paragraph>INOmax appears to increase the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) by  dilating pulmonary vessels in better ventilated areas of the lung, redistributing pulmonary blood flow away from lung regions with low ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratios toward regions with normal ratios.</paragraph></text>

<text><paragraph>Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) occurs as a primary developmental defect or as a condition secondary to other diseases such as meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), pneumonia, sepsis, hyaline membrane disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and pulmonary hypoplasia.  In these states, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is high, which results in hypoxemia secondary to right-to-left shunting of blood through the patent ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale.  In neonates with PPHN, INOmax improves oxygenation (as indicated by significant increases in PaO<sub>2</sub>). </paragraph></text>

<title mediaType="text/x-hl7-title+xml">Uptake and Distribution</title>
<text><paragraph>Nitric oxide is absorbed systemically after inhalation.  Most of it traverses the pulmonary capillary bed where it combines with hemoglobin that is 60% to 100% oxygen-saturated.  At this level of oxygen saturation, nitric oxide combines predominantly with oxyhemoglobin to produce methemoglobin and nitrate.  At low oxygen saturation, nitric oxide can combine with deoxyhemoglobin to transiently form nitrosylhemoglobin, which is converted to nitrogen oxides and methemoglobin upon exposure to oxygen.  Within the pulmonary system, nitric oxide can  combine with oxygen and water to produce nitrogen dioxide and nitrite, respectively, which interact with oxyhemoglobin to produce methemoglobin and nitrate.  Thus, the end products of nitric oxide that enter the systemic circulation are predominantly methemoglobin and nitrate.</paragraph></text>

<title mediaType="text/x-hl7-title+xml">(i) NINOS study</title>
<text><paragraph>The Neonatal Inhaled Nitric Oxide Study (NINOS) group conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in 235 neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure.  The objective of the study was to determine whether inhaled nitric oxide would reduce the occurrence of death and/or initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in a prospectively defined cohort of term or near-term neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure unresponsive to conventional therapy.  Hypoxic respiratory failure was caused by meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS; 49%), pneumonia/sepsis (21%), idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN; 17%), or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS; 11%). Infants &#8804;14 days of age (mean, 1.7 days) with a mean PaO<sub>2</sub> of 46 mm Hg and a mean oxygenation index (OI) of 43 cm H<sub>2</sub>O / mm Hg were initially randomized to receive 100% O<sub>2</sub> with (n=114) or without (n=121) 20 ppm nitric oxide for up to 14 days.  Response to study drug was defined as a change from baseline in PaO<sub>2</sub> 30 minutes after starting treatment (full response = &gt;20 mm Hg, partial = 10&#8211;20 mm Hg, no response = &lt;10 mm Hg).  Neonates with a less than full response were evaluated for a response to 80 ppm nitric oxide or control gas.  The primary results from the NINOS study are presented in Table 1.</paragraph><table width="70%"><caption>Table 1 Summary of Clinical Results from NINOS Study</caption>

</table><paragraph>Although the incidence of death by 120 days of age was similar in both groups (NO, 14%; control, 17%), significantly fewer infants in the nitric oxide group required ECMO compared with controls (39% vs. 55%, p = 0.014).  The combined incidence of death and/or initiation of ECMO showed a significant advantage for the nitric oxide treated group (46% vs. 64%, p = 0.006).  The nitric oxide group also had significantly greater increases in PaO<sub>2</sub> and greater decreases in the OI and the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient than the control group (p&lt;0.001 for all parameters).  Significantly more patients had at least a partial response to the initial administration of study drug in the nitric oxide group (66%) than the control group (26%, p&lt;0.001).  Of the 125 infants who did not respond to 20 ppm nitric oxide or control, similar percentages of  NO-treated (18%) and control (20%) patients had at least a partial response to 80 ppm nitric oxide for inhalation or control drug, suggesting a lack of additional benefit for the higher dose of nitric oxide.  No infant had study drug discontinued for toxicity. Inhaled nitric oxide had no detectable effect on mortality. The adverse events collected in the NINOS trial occurred at similar incidence rates in both treatment groups (See <linkHtml href="#ADVERSE_REACTIONS">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>).  Follow-up exams were  performed at 18&#8211;24 months for the infants enrolled in this trial.  In the infants with available follow-up, the two treatment groups  were similar with respect to their mental, motor, audiologic, or neurologic evaluations.</paragraph></text>

<text><paragraph>No formal drug-interaction studies have been performed, and a clinically significant interaction with other medications used in the treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure cannot be excluded based on the available data. INOmax has been administered with tolazoline, dopamine, dobutamine, steroids, surfactant, and high-frequency ventilation. Although there are no study data to evaluate the possibility, nitric oxide donor compounds, including sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerin, may have an additive effect with INOmax on the risk of developing methemoglobinemia. An association between prilocaine and an increased risk of methaemoglobinaemia, particularly in infants, has specifically been described in a literature case report. This risk is present whether the drugs are administered as oral, parenteral, or topical formulations.</paragraph></text>

<title mediaType="text/x-hl7-title+xml">Dosage</title>
<text><paragraph>The recommended dose of INOmax is 20 ppm. Treatment should be maintained up to 14 days or until the underlying oxygen desaturation has resolved and the neonate is ready to be weaned from INOmax therapy.</paragraph><paragraph>An initial dose of 20 ppm was used in the NINOS and CINRGI trials.  In CINRGI, patients whose oxygenation improved with 20 ppm were dose-reduced to 5 ppm as tolerated at the end of 4 hours of treatment.  In the NINOS trial, patients whose oxygenation failed to improve on 20 ppm could be increased to 80 ppm, but those patients did not then improve on the higher dose.  As the risk of methemoglobinemia and elevated NO<sub>2</sub> levels increases significantly when INOmax is administered at doses &gt;20 ppm, doses above this level ordinarily should not be used.</paragraph></text>

<title mediaType="text/x-hl7-title+xml">Administration</title>
<text><paragraph>Additional therapies should be used to maximize oxygen delivery. In patients with collapsed alveoli, additional therapies might include surfactant and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.</paragraph><paragraph>The safety and effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide have been established in a population receiving other therapies for hypoxic respiratory failure, including vasodilators, intravenous fluids, bicarbonate therapy, and mechanical ventilation. Different dose regimens for nitric oxide were used in the clinical studies (see <linkHtml href="#CLINICAL_TRIALS">CLINICAL TRIALS</linkHtml>). </paragraph><paragraph>INOmax should be administered with monitoring for PaO<sub>2</sub>, methemoglobin, and NO<sub>2</sub>.</paragraph><paragraph>The nitric oxide delivery systems used in the clinical trials provided operator-determined concentrations of nitric oxide in the breathing gas, and the concentration was constant throughout the respiratory cycle.  INOmax must be delivered through a system with these characteristics and which does not cause generation of excessive inhaled nitrogen dioxide.  The INOvent&#8482; system and other systems meeting these criteria were used in the clinical trials.  In the ventilated neonate, precise monitoring of inspired nitric oxide and NO<sub>2</sub> should be instituted, using a properly calibrated analysis device with alarms.  The system should be calibrated using a precisely defined calibration mixture of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, such as INOcal&#8482;.   Sample gas for analysis should be drawn before the Y-piece, proximal to the patient. Oxygen levels should also be measured.  </paragraph><paragraph>In the event of a system failure or a wall-outlet power failure, a backup battery power supply and reserve nitric oxide delivery system should be available.</paragraph><paragraph>The INOmax dose should not be discontinued abruptly as it may result in an increase in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and/or worsening of blood oxygenation (PaO<sub>2</sub>).  Deterioration in oxygenation and elevation in PAP may also occur in children with no apparent response to INOmax.  Discontinue/wean cautiously.</paragraph></text>
